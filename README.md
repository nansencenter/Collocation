Collocation
===========

An illustration of regression applied to meteorology and oceanography, where one
dataset might be a collection of isolated samples and another is an estimate with
good coverage in space and/or time.  Naturally, errors exist in both data sources
(cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors-in-variables_models).  Synergy requires
that the (affine) relationship between the two is quantified, although no other
restriction concerning functional dependence of such a relationship is necessary
(this might be limited only by the number of samples and imagination).  The focus
is on a retrieval of regression slope because all kinds of metrics of interest
can then be obtained.
