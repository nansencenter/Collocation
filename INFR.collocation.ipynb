    "One benefit of modelling dependent errors is that the waiting time for physical calibration and validation of a new satellite can be reduced considerably when two instead of three collocations are employed (Su et al. 2014).  Here, we demonstrate the retrieval of regression slope using two collocation methods: standard triple collocation (Stoffelen 1998) and a collocation of only two datasets, but where one dataset offers five samples (the other four samples being \"nearby\" in time or space).  We show that both methods (triple collocation and a so-called INFERS method) provide good estimates of regression slope.\n",

    "We thus allow for correlated errors, possibly because the in situ data is assimilated by the analysis ($\\lambda_N \\epsilon_I$) or because there is common error in adjacent analysis windows (i.e., taking \"persistence\" as a reasonable forecast or revcast, shared error is accommodated by nonzero $\\lambda_F$ and $\\lambda_R$).  Retrieval of $\\beta_N$ employs a cost function defined by the covariance of FR and ES.  In particular, the method requires error correlation between E and S (cf. discussion of instrumental variable regression in Su et al. 2014).  This is in stark contrast to the triple collocation method, where error correlation is to be avoided; here, error correlation is not only helpful, it is required!  In practice, analyses admit observations in windows that are typically as large or larger than the interval between analyses (note that fractional ES error covariance is also quantified by the product $\\lambda_E \\lambda_F \\lambda_R \\lambda_S$)."
