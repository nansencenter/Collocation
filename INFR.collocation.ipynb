    "One benefit of modelling dependent errors is that the waiting time for physical calibration and validation of a new satellite can be reduced considerably when two instead of three collocations are employed (Su et al. 2014).  Here, we demonstrate the retrieval of regression slope using two collocation methods: standard triple collocation (Stoffelen 1998) and a collocation of only two datasets, but where one dataset offers three samples (the other two samples being \"nearby\" in time or space).  We show that both methods (triple and INFR) provide estimates of regression slope.\n",
